# DeepLab 

## Introduction

We want to do image segmentation

we have a nice dataset to do it

this dataset have been used as a benchmark for deep learning models

we want to reproduce the DeepLab algorithm and have the same result on the testing dataset

## Dataset

The documentation about the Pascal VOC2012 development kit [devkit_doc.pdf](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/devkit_doc.pdf) explains the context of the Pascal VOC2012 contests

The training and validation datasets are specified in the VOCdevkit\VOC2012\ImageSets\Segmentation folder. There are 1464 images for the training dataset and 1449 images for the validation dataset

The testing dataset is available on the official [evaluation and download server](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/)
